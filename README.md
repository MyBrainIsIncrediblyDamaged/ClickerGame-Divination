### Clicks of Divination

This is a clicker game where you click on a button (The magic mirror looking thing) then buy sources for automatic profit(like crystal balls or sacred texts).
As of the 9/23/2024 Upload, there is no save system.

## To run the game
install a JDK, you can use the following link, or whatever suits your fancy.

## Development (Summarized)
Clicker game project given out to the class.
### Creation of Clicks of Divination's rough outline.
    Created 3 groups, Sources, Clicks and Upgrades
    Completed a system to monitor stats.
    Made the click button work.
    Peered through the Idle Wizard Fandom page for some number designations to steal(up to source 6);
    Made the Profit Sources generate profit, and did some number stuff.
    Made the Upgrades modify the sources, or the stats.
    Created Summons(AutoClickers), taking pictures from quick Google searches(will fix later, if development continues)
    Made the UI look better with all that craziness.
### Added the Tarot Drawing Mechanic
    Did a ridiculous amount of StackOverflow searching.
    Found the layout I wanted.
    Implemented the layout.
    Created a Tarot Deck using a poker deck as an example.
    Forgot to add fortunes, so I made a 78-line wall that gave each card a fortune.
    Created a panel for storing card effects and stuff
    made the panel exist in the main setup
    made the deck shuffle after drawing the deck empty.
    Forgot to add effects, and with little patience to add 78 whole individual effects, Shortened it down to 50.
    Added the effects in a switch statement.
    updated Visual Studio Code.
    Got a bunch of errors that were not popping up before
    went troubleshooting for a while.
    got the Tarot panel to actually function.
    implemented it.
    set up a layout for it(the current one is probably temporary).
