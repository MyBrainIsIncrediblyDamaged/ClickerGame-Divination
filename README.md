        My problems were plenty, Such as reset buttons, broken upgrades, broken counters, etc. I still have an upgrades issue.

  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?

  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?

  of working on this project?

  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
